# Mandelbrot Viewer
Just a project in java while I was bored to see if I could make a mandelbrot set
viewer that lets me zoom in and is efficient on the CPU and memory.

At the moment, it is only capped at zooming in by my use of Java's doubles which are 64bit
numbers. (32bit for whole number and 32bit for the decimal place.).
